# Employee-Tracker
## Description
This challenge was designed so that we would work to know our way around mySQL and using the databases to retrieve the necessary information. For this Employee Tracker challenge I created a schema.sql that sets up the database as well as the three tables needed; Department, Role, Employees. Then I created a seed.sql file to input data into the database so that it appears used and there is data to manipulate. Finally within the server.js file I connected the project to the database and used inquirer to get user input from the terminal to decide what is needed to be queried from the database and displayed.

## Technologies Used
mySql, inquirer, javaScript
